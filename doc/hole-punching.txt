A wants to send from A:r to B:p
B wants to send from B:s to A:q (p and q are probably really the same...)

Problem: NAT N_a translates r to some unknown t (and keeps a mapping t->A:r). 
And NAT N_b drops the datagram (because it has no mapping u->B:p)

Solution:
A sends from A:r to S. N_a translates r to some v.
B sends from B:s to S. N_b translates s to some w.

S tells A to send directly to B:w. S tells B to send directly to A:v
