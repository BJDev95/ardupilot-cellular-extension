Data chunking at send:
AT+CIPSEND=10				length of 10
AT+CIPATS=<mode>,<time> then AT+SIPSEND Timeout (what is mode?)
AT+CIPSEND?				Query max. length




State machine proposal!

1 AT+CPIN?  --> no good, send PIN code.
2 AT+CSQ?   --> too bad, complain
3 AT+CREG?  --> if 0, ?
4 AT+CGATT? --> if 0, do..? Reset AT+CFUN=1,1 seemed to help.
5 AT+CSTT="internet"   (at&w does not store this)
6 AT+CIICR
7 AT+CIFSR (maybe not necesary, just query IP address?)

10 AT+CIPSTART=....
wait for CONNECT OK
11 AT+CIPSEND wait for >
12 send, CTRL-Z
<data in other direction just arrives...>



From the forum mail:

Own suggestion:

AT V1 E1 X1 S0=0

AT+CPIN
If not READY, either set pin or give up.

AT+IURC=0
AT+CMEE=0

AT+CREG?
if not 1, try set to 1

AT+CGATT?
if not 1, try set to 1

AT+CDNSCFG?





Senddata example with > enabled:
at+cipsend=5
> asdfg
SEND OK


Senddata example with > disabled:




The one with enabling URCs
AT+CSCS

AT+CGACT
AT+CGCLASS?
AT+CGDCONT
AT+CGEREP=2
AT+IFC=0,0 (none) or AT+IFC=2,2(hardware)

We maintain a state of the condition of the connection:
Not call-ready (is PIN unlocked?)
Not attached
Attached but not connected AT+CGATT
Connected with .../... bps
etc..
We query the state(s) regularaly.
We send Mavlink text messages to the other interface regularly.
Can also send operator+ AT+COPS

One idea: Leave the configuration in the SIM card phonebook or in a SIM card SMS.
Other idea: Leave a phone number of an emergency number to send SMSes to, in case the connection fails.

Flow control: Software is not possible!
