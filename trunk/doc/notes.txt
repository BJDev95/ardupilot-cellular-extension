URCs
About URC collision avoidance:
If an AT command is finished (with "OK" or "ERROR") the TE shall always wait at least 100 milliseconds
before sending the next one. This gives MC45 / MC46 the opportunity to transmit pending
URCs and get necessary service.
Some AT commands may require more delay after an "OK" or "ERROR" response, refer to the following
command specifications for details.
The TE shall communicate with MC45 / MC46 using activated echo (ATE1), i.e. MC45 / MC46
echoes characters received from the TE.
Hence, when the TE receives the echo of the first character "A" of the AT command just sent by itself
it has control both over the receive and the transmit paths. This way, no URC can be issued by
MC45 / MC46 in between.

To announce a pending URC transmission the ME will do the following:
The ME activates its Ring line (logic "1") for one second, i.e. the line changes to physical "Low"
level. This allows the TE to enter power saving mode until ME related events request service.
If the AT command interface is busy a "BREAK" will be sent immediately but the URC will not be
issued until the line is free. This may happen if the URC is pending
- while an AT command is being processed, i.e. during the time from sending the first character
"A" of an AT command by the TE until the ME has responded with "OK" or "ERROR", or
- during a data call.
Please note that AT command settings may be necessary to enable in-band signaling. For example,
refer to AT+CMER or AT+CNMI.


Character sets:
The ME supports two character sets: GSM 03.38 (7 bit, also referred to as SMS alphabet) and UCS2
(16 bit, refer to ISO/IEC 10646 (aka Unicode)). See Chapter 4.44 for information about selecting the character set.
Character tables are provided in Chapter 9.5.

DCS, Data Coding Scheme: SMS-on-SIM coding scheme
IRA: translating a byte to 2 ASCII characters representing the hex value of the byte

Character set commands: AT+CSCS



Common commands:
ATA answer incoming call
ATH hangup
ATX Tone detection when calling...

AT&W Write user profile

AT&C Set carrier detect mode (0=always on, 1=when data carrier present. Default is 1)
AT&D Set DTR mode (allows dropping a data call when DTR goes offline)
AT&S Set DSR mode (0=always on, default. 1=on in data mode)

ATZ  set parameters from user profile
AT&F set parameters to factory defaults


AT\Qn set flow control (3=hardware)

AT+GCAP Capabilities list
AT+GSN  EMEI
AT+ILRR Local data ("baud") rate reporting
AT+IPR  set local data rate

Error reports:
ATV: Set result code format ("OK" or "0" etc)
AT+CEER (extended error report for voice)
AT+CMEE set mobile equipment error reporting (more that just "ERROR")

Power and Alarm:
AT+CALA set alarm
AT+CCLK set clock
AT^SBC  current consumption
AT^SCTM temperature
AT^SMSO shutdown
AT+CFUN set phone functionality (use 7 (2 seconds) or 8 (10 minutes) and use hardware flow control). However If the ME is in Multiplexer mode, it is not recommended to activate SLEEP mode with AT+CFUN=<n>. The best approach to properly control SLEEP mode in this case is to issue the PSC messages described in [5], Chapter Power saving control (PSC).
SYNC LED will stop flashing in power save mode.

SMS:
From AT&V, display current configuration:
The parameters of AT^SMGO can only be displayed after the SMS data from
the SIM have been read successfully for the first time. Reading starts after
successful SIM authentication has been performed, and may take up to 30
seconds depending on the SIM used. While the read process is in progress,
an attempt to read the parameter will result in empty values.
The parameter of AT+CSDH will only be displayed in SMS text mode, i.e. if
AT+CMGF=1.

AT+CMGF Set SMS message format (0=PDU, 1=text)
AT+CMGL List SMS messages from preferred store
AT+CMGS Send SMS message
AT+CMGC Send an SMS command



Data:
AT+CRLP Select radio link protocol param. for orig. non-transparent data call
